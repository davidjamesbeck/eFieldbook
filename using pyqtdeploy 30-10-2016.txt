using pyqtdeploy
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/pyqtdeploy/static_builds.html
http://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git

1) make a PyQtDeploy directory ($DEPLOYMENT) and a sysroot-macosx subdirectory ($SYSROOT)
2) export SYSROOT=/Users/David/OpenSource/ELFBDeployment/sysroot-macosx

BUILD QT
1) Qt installers seem to work now

USING build-sysroot.py 
(file:///Users/David/OpenSource/PyQtDeploy/sysroot-macosx/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pyqtdeploy-1.3.2.dev1610282346/doc/html/build_sysroot.html)

1) create a src subdirectory inside $SYSROOT
2) get the archived source files ('.zip', '.tar.gz', '.tar.xz', '.tar.bz2' formats) for Python, sip, and PyQt and put them in src. Don't extract!
3) get the latest build-sysroot.py file from Mercurial (there's a link on the last page of the pyqtdeploy manual, use "raw" link to download file) and put it in $DEPLOYMENT
4) cd $DEPLOYMENT
6) hack the qmake(self) method to return the location of the qmake binary you want to use instead of the symbolic link the script creates (which seems not to work). 
7) sudo python3 build-sysroot.py  --sysroot /Users/David/OpenSource/$SYSROOT --all
7) This should take care of everything, though you might have to install the packages one by one (type --build package instead of --all. At this point see the documentation.)

RUNNING PYQTDEPLOY
1)cd $SYSROOT
2) pyqtdeploy myproject.pdy

BUNDLING WITH XCODE
https://plashless.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/using-xcode-to-bundle-a-pyqt-pyqtdeployed-app-that-is-sandboxed-and-code-signed/
1) Download and install the qtLibPathFacade module for Python (https://github.com/bootchk/qtLibPathFacade). Follow the example given there to add one line to your main(), before you instantiate QApplication. (See main script file of ELFB)
2) cd /Users/David/OpenSource/$SYSROOT/build
3) /Users/David/OpenSource/Qt5.7/5.7/clang_64/bin/qmake -spec macx-xcode eFieldbook.pro (this creates eFieldbook.xcodeproj)
4) doubleclick to open in XCode
5) select project in left sidebar of centre pane
6) select “Build Phases” in the top menubar of the middle pane
7) Select “+” in top left corner of new tab
8) Choose “New Run Script Phase” and expand by clicking on triangle to the right of the new phase that appears at the bottom of the list
9) paste in  “/Users/David/OpenSource/Qt5.7/5.7/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/eFieldbook.app”
10) Choose “Capabilities” in top menubar of the middle pane, toggle “App Sandbox” to “ON”; set File access “User selected files”
11) Work out the code signing later
12) Go to Products > Archive in the XCode menubar at the top of of the screen
